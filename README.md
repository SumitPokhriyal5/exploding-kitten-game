# Exploding Kitten Game

## Overview
This is an online single-player card game built using React and Vite. The game consists of 4 different types of cards:

- Cat card üòº
- Defuse card üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Shuffle card üîÄ
- Exploding kitten card üí£

The objective of the game is for the player to draw all 5 cards from the deck without drawing an exploding kitten card. 

## How to Play
1. Once the game starts, a deck of 5 cards is generated randomly.
2. Click on the deck to draw a card.
3. If the card drawn is a cat card, it is removed from the deck.
4. If the card drawn is an exploding kitten card, the player loses the game.
5. If the card drawn is a defuse card, it is removed from the deck and can be used to defuse one bomb that may come in subsequent cards.
6. If the card drawn is a shuffle card, the game is restarted, and the deck is filled with 5 cards again.
7. Continue drawing cards until all 5 cards are drawn from the deck or an exploding kitten card is drawn.

## Rules

- Defuse card üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Removed from the deck and can be used to defuse one bomb.
